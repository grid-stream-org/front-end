## üöÄ Local Run

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** and **Yarn** must be installed on your machine. You can verify if you have these by running the following commands

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
nvm -v  # For Windows, use 'nvm version'
```

#### Windows

- You can download Node.js from the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en)
- After installing Node.js, install Node Version Manager (`nvm`) by following [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)
- After installing Node.js, install Yarn by running

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

#### macOS

- On macOS, you can install Node.js via Homebrew

```bash
brew install node
```

- To install Node Version Manager (`nvm`), also use Homebrew

```bash
brew install nvm
```

**Note**: I had some issues with nvm not being added to my path, so if after installing you still cannot run `nvm -v`, add it to your path and try again

```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
```

- To install Yarn, also use Homebrew

```bash
brew install yarn
```

- If you do not have Homebrew on your mac, I would highly recommend installing it [here](https://brew.sh/).

### Steps

1. First, start by cloning this repository to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/grid-stream-org/front-end.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory

```bash
cd frontend
```

3. Install and use the version of node specified in the `.nvmrc` file by running the following commands

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

Note:
You may have to specify the actual version you wish to user here, as some operating systems don't pick up on the contents of the `.nvmrc` file. Try `nvm install <version> && nvm use <version>`

4. Install the necessary dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

5. Create a .`.env` file in the root of the project and populate with required values

6. At this point, you can run the client

```bash
yarn run dev
```

Client application should be running at `http://localhost:5173`
